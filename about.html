    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>
      My mission is simple — to help families and individuals find the home that truly fits their lifestyle, goals, and future.  
      Whether you’re a first-time buyer, an investor, or looking to sell your current home, I’m here to make the process clear, confident, and rewarding.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Work With Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Local expertise — I live and work right here in North Idaho.</li>
      <li>✔ Honest communication and full transparency throughout the process.</li>
      <li>✔ Backed by the trusted team at <strong>Future Realty Idaho</strong>.</li>
      <li>✔ A commitment to helping you achieve your real estate goals efficiently and stress-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I live in Rathdrum, Idaho, with my wife and three children.  
      Outside of real estate, I work at the Post Office and value the importance of community, hard work, and balance.  
      I’ve learned that life’s too short not to pursue what you’re passionate about — and for me, that’s helping others move forward in life through real estate.
