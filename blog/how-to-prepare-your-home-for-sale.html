  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-center text-blue-900">🏡 How to Prepare Your Home for Sale</h1>
  <p class="mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Selling your home is one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll make — and preparation plays a huge role in getting top dollar. 
    The goal is to help buyers imagine themselves living there while highlighting your home’s best features. 
    Here’s how to make sure your home shines before it hits the market.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-blue-800">1. Start with Curb Appeal</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    First impressions matter. The exterior of your home is the first thing buyers see — online and in person. <br><br>
    ✅ Mow the lawn, trim the bushes, and plant some fresh flowers. <br>
    ✅ Pressure wash the driveway, walkways, and siding. <br>
    ✅ Repaint or touch up the front door for a welcoming entry. <br><br>
    A clean, inviting exterior sets the tone for what’s inside.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-blue-800">2. Declutter and Depersonalize</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Buyers want to picture themselves living in the home — not your family. <br><br>
    🧹 Remove excess furniture, knick-knacks, and personal photos. <br>
    📦 Consider renting a storage unit for extra belongings. <br><br>
    This helps rooms look bigger, cleaner, and more appealing.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-blue-800">3. Deep Clean Everything</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    A spotless home tells buyers it’s been well cared for. <br><br>
    🧽 Scrub floors, baseboards, windows, and bathrooms. <br>
    ✨ Don’t forget details like vents, light fixtures, and inside cabinets. <br><br>
    A fresh scent and shine make a lasting impression.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-blue-800">4. Make Minor Repairs</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Small issues can add up and turn buyers away. <br><br>
    🔧 Fix leaky faucets, squeaky doors, and burnt-out lightbulbs. <br>
    🎨 Patch holes and touch up paint where needed. <br><br>
    These simple fixes make your home feel move-in ready.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-blue-800">5. Neutralize and Brighten</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Buyers love light, open spaces. <br><br>
    💡 Repaint bold-colored walls with neutral tones like beige, gray, or soft white. <br>
    🪟 Open blinds and curtains to let natural light in. <br><br>
    A neutral, bright space appeals to a wider range of buyers.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-blue-800">6. Stage Your Home</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Professional staging can help your home sell faster and for more money — but you can also DIY it. <br><br>
    🛋️ Arrange furniture to show off space and flow. <br>
    🌿 Add a few plants, cozy throws, and clean décor. <br><br>
    Staging helps buyers emotionally connect with the space.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-blue-800">7. Hire a Realtor Who Knows the Market</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Working with a local agent who understands your community is key. <br><br>
    A good realtor will: <br>
    • Help price your home strategically <br>
    • Market it with professional photos and online exposure <br>
    • Negotiate the best offer on your behalf <br><br>
    If you’re in <strong>Rathdrum, Coeur d’Alene, Hayden, or Post Falls</strong>, I’d be happy to help you prepare your home, create a custom pricing strategy, and make your sale as smooth as possible.
