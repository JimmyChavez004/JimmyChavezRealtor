    <p>Buying a home in North Idaho is an exciting step — but before you start house hunting, it’s crucial to understand how much you can comfortably afford. Your budget determines not only the price range but also the type of home and community that best fit your lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>1. Know Your Monthly Comfort Zone</h2>
    <p>A general rule of thumb is to keep your housing costs — including your mortgage, taxes, and insurance — under 30% of your monthly income. This ensures financial stability and flexibility for other expenses.</p>

    <h2>2. Consider North Idaho’s Cost Differences</h2>
    <p>Homes in Coeur d’Alene and Post Falls tend to cost more than those in Rathdrum or Spirit Lake. Property taxes are relatively low compared to other states, but utility and HOA costs vary by neighborhood.</p>

    <h2>3. Talk to a Local Lender Early</h2>
    <p>Pre-approval helps you know your exact buying power. Local lenders in Kootenai County understand market-specific factors like taxes, insurance, and regional loan programs.</p>

    <h2>4. Plan for the Hidden Costs</h2>
    <p>Home inspections, closing costs, and maintenance expenses add up. Budgeting for these ensures no surprises during the process.</p>
