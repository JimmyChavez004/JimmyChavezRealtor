    <p>Timing can make a huge difference when selling your home. In North Idaho, our unique four-season climate and tourism-driven economy influence when buyers are most active.</p>

    <h2>Spring and Summer: Peak Market Activity</h2>
    <p>Most homes sell between March and August when families prepare for the new school year. Curb appeal is at its best, and longer days make showings easier.</p>

    <h2>Fall: Serious Buyers, Less Competition</h2>
    <p>In the fall, the market cools slightly, but buyers are often more motivated. Inventory drops, meaning your home could stand out with the right marketing.</p>

    <h2>Winter: A Hidden Opportunity</h2>
    <p>Winter may seem slow, but motivated buyers—especially relocations from states like California and Washington—are still shopping online. With fewer homes for sale, you face less competition.</p>

    <h2>Final Tip: Focus on Presentation</h2>
    <p>Regardless of season, clean, declutter, and highlight your home’s best features. Partnering with a professional like <strong>Jimmy Chavez, Realtor®</strong> ensures you price it right and market it effectively.</p>
